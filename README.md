# Notes app built in the Rust frontend framework Yew

In this repository i have written a simple note keeping Yew app using Tailwind as a CSS framework with the intent of trying out Rust frontend development as a JavaScript/TypeScript+React replacement.

To run the example you need to install the Trunk crate binary globally using cargo and then run the command `trunk serve` in the repo's root.
